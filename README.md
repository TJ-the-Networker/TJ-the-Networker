## 🫅 About Me
The people call me TJ. I am a United States Air Force veteran who finished a six year contract not ago. I first got interested into the tech space via my main hobby: gaming 🎮. My initial interest was more towards the offensive testing side of tech but as 
I gained more information, I'm leaning now more towards networking. My main goal, as of now, is to become a Network Engineer. I'm actively working towards getting my CompTIA Network+ and CCNA ( Cisco Certified Network Associate) certifications. The purpose of this
